This repository provides the **BSDS500 dataset**, a benchmark dataset for **image segmentation and edge detection**. It contains manually labeled **ground-truth segmentations** and is used in our research on **Hybrid Marker Extraction by Gradient and Spectral Features (HMEGS)** for **marker-controlled watershed segmentation**.
