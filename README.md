This repository provides the **BSDS500 dataset**, a benchmark dataset for **image segmentation and edge detection**. It contains manually labeled **ground-truth segmentations** and is used in our research on **Hybrid Marker Extraction by Gradient and Spectral Features (HMEGS)** for **marker-controlled watershed segmentation**.

## 📄 Research Paper
This dataset supports our research paper:

**📌 Title:** *A Hybrid Marker Extraction Method by Gradient and Spectral Features for Marker-Controlled Watershed Segmentation*  
**✍️ Authors:** S.B. Hossaini, S.M. Mousavi, A. Bavafatoosi
